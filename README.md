# Pewlett Hackard Employee Analysis
Module 9 SQL Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining over 300,000 employees that were employeed through the 1980s and 1990s.
We included an Entity Relationship Diagram and the corresponding exported sql file.
We looked through different queries to try to find meaningful conclusions about the employees.

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my SQL and ERD knowledge.
I looked at six different csv files and created a physical ERD based off of those files as well as PNG/SVG images of the ERD.
Then, I exported the ERD into PostgresSQL and imported the csv files into the tables.
Finally, I ran 8 different queries using the six tables.

The file types in this repository are sql files, csv files, png files, svg files, txt files and md files.
